Vermont Artist Directory
========================

Purpose
-------

The Vermont Artist Directory is used by the public, venues, and artists to identify and connect with bands or performers for weddings, club shows, or gig swaps/special projects. It should have enough content, including music and photographs, to give a clear idea of what kind of music the artist plays and make them accessible to anyone through the Big Heave World site. It's an overview of Vermont's music community, and should be searchable by genre or geographic region, and connect with band's social network sites.
